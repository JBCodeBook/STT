     <p>well %HESITATION thank you for being here thanks %HESITATION %HESITATION really appreciative of your time in the fact that you are willing to talk about this this is a very interesting book an extremely controversial and I'm not exactly sure why that is but I think it's part of the times we're living in now how many cut your your book is called unsettled correct net how many orders yes I how many copies of this book so we sold since it was published at the end of April so about ten minutes ago we sold more than a hundred twenty thousand copies a hundred twenty housing which is hard you know I don't know anything about publishing but my agent and publisher sort of amazed at the numbers that's a lot and without much fanfare from the media if any well depends which media you look at where and where have you gotten service I've gotten good coverage from the Wall Street journal all but if you look at the New York times Washington post of not very good coverage at all did make the New York times bestseller that's seems strange because there's a lot of copies yeah right well you would think right yeah okay CNN nothing %HESITATION and %HESITATION I think you know people are just ignoring it which really surprises me now your book is on the climb it's on climate change and climate science and we should just established right away %HESITATION just because I know you're gonna experience with some criticism right right clearly %HESITATION first of all your credentials you graduated from high school at six </p>
     <p>I mean you will %HESITATION went to M. I. T. R. Caltech for outsiders and undergrad at cal tech and then I went to M. I. T. I. did a PhD there in theoretical physics in three years and then I went back to cal tech where I was on the faculty for thirty years can you were on the faculty at twenty three years of age that's correct pretty extraordinary it's on usual not unprecedented but really quite unusual now %HESITATION there's a there's a couple criticisms that people have of you just just to get these out of the way right away one of them is that you used to work for BP yeah that is this is a big one so if you work for some sort of an oil company you were chief scientist I was in chief scientist at B. P. for five years after Celtic arm and you know they didn't bring me there to help them find oil aren't they know how to do that really well I was brought in to help figure out what beyond petroleum really meant and that was renewables and alternatives to oil and gas and I help during my five years to help part of strategy for that which is today now fifteen years later are starting to be realized but once you say you work for B. P. there's a certain section of our population that will immediately dismiss anything you said yeah of course and and you know it's part of a structural problem that </p>
<h3>Speaker 1</h3>
     <p>the advantage of having been in B. P. is I learned about the energy system and I teach at NYU these days adjusted by first lecture yesterday and so I actually know quite a bit about how the energy system currently works and a lot of people who are going to change energy system have no idea at all </p>

     <p>of how it works and so they can do great damage if they do the wrong sort of thing well in reading your book one of the things that who became very clear is there's so much data to sort through it's it's incredibly complex I live actually listen to it on audio anywhere sections of it where I had to go back over it again just to try to wrap my head exactly around what was happening </p>
     <p>to squash some more the criticism really clearly up front </p>
     <p>you are you're very clear about this you believe the climate is changing climate is changing I believe that human beings are having an effect they are influencing those changes yes absolutely mostly through greenhouse gases that are accumulating in the atmosphere absolutely your position though is that there's an either an exaggeration or there's there's a way that people are looking at the data that's alarmist that you don't think is reflected by the actual numbers themselves that's correct I think that you know to put it in a British sense of they have over egged the custard </p>
     <p>now why do you think this has happened you know there's I I have in the book one of my favorite quotes from HL Mencken is the purpose of practical politics is to keep people are longer by a series of mostly imaginary hobgoblins so that they can be clamoring to be led to safety </p>
     <p>now if you think that human beings are affecting the climate and you think the climate is changing </p>
